#' Construct a data frame of claims simulated by time between events.
#'
#' @title ClaimsByWaitTime
#'
#' @param dfPolicy A data frame of policy records
#' @param ClaimFrequency Number of claims per policy; can be a distribution.
#' @param PaymentFrequency Number of payments per claim; can be a distribution.
#' @param OccurrenceWait Time until occurrence for each claim; can be a distribution
#' @param ReportWait Time until report; can be a distribution.
#' @param PayWait Lag time between payments; can be a distribution.
#' @param PaySeverity Severity of each claim payment; can be a distribution.
#' @param PayOnlyPositive Boolean indicating whether to discard negative payments.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' This function will generate claim transactions.
#'
#' Wait times and frequencies will be converted to integers with no message. If wait times or claim frequencies
#' are less than zero, or payment frequencies are less than one, they will be converted with a message.
